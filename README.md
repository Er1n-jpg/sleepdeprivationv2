**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE USING IT IS IMPORTANT**
This is a program that tracks sees if you have closed your eyes for more than a minute and emails your email of choice. Initially this project was made to counter the fact I kept on sleeping in class + keep me accountable
and it was also an excuse for me to make my very first project in OpenCV in a language i'm super familliar with!

You can access this project through downloading one of the .exe files on the releases page (*warning!! .exe's are only for windows this is NOT mac compatable sorry) or it is accessable through a itch page [insert link]. It might give you a suspicious application warning but just click past that I PINKY PROMISE IM NOT TRYING TO HACK YOU!


**How to navigate this project?**
When you first open the .exe file you will be greeted with the main screen which might look a little something like this!
<img width="1650" height="1080" alt="Blinked too long (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6c1e0c-27f9-47cd-b8bc-2653d3c1fb80" />


This screen gives you 2 options, one of them is the "To-email" option which is mandatory and it will not let you continue to the camera stage without having entered a valid email. The second option
is the message area where you can customize the email sender message, this is optional and if you choose not to do it, the program will send a default email saying "user is asleep".


Once getting past the intial screen it will bring you to a loading screen (noticable by the big loading word).

 Once opencv is loaded you will see a reflection of your face and you will see squares that track your face and eyes. The frame rate will highly depend on your RAM. 

 **How to use**
 Close your eyes and keep them closed for about 10 seconds or even more depending on your RAM and frame rate. After opening your eyes check the designated to-email and there should be an email from the adress blinkedtoolong@gmail.com in which will notify you with the body message being the message option on the initial screen. If the email hasn't sent it might be because of a false detection **BE PATIENT AI MAKES MISTAKES**.
