This is a program that tracks sees if you have closed your eyes for more than a minute and emails your email of choice. Initially this project was made to counter the fact I kept on sleeping in class + keep me accountable
and it was also an excuse for me to make my very first project in OpenCV in a language i'm super familliar with!

You can access this project through downloading one of the .exe files on the releases page (*warning!! .exe's are only for windows this is NOT mac compatable sorry)

**How to navigate this project?**
When you first open the .exe file you will be greeted with the main screen which might look a little something like this!
[insert screen photo]

This screen gives you 2 options, one of them is the "To-email" option which is mandatory and it will not let you continue to the camera stage without having entered a valid email. The second option
is the message area where you can customize the email sender message, this is optional and if you choose not to do it, the program will send a default email saying "user is asleep"
